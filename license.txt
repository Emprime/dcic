The data-centric image classification benchmark also referred to as DCIC is multi-domain benchmark for noisy and ambiguous label estimation.
The benchmark consists of firstly the provided source code for the baseline methods, evaluation protocols, meta data, documentation all all other files in this repository (referred to as benchmark source code) and secondly the datasets including images and annotations itself (referred to as benchmark datasets).
